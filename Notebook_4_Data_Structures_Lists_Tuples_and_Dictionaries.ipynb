Lists and dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their contents, while tuples are immutable. These data structures will allow you to organize and manage data in your Python programs more effectively."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
