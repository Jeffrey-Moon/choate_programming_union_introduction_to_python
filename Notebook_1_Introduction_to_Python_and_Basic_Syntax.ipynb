Setting up Python and VSCode\n","\n","Before we begin coding, we need to set up two things on your computer:\n","\n","1. **Python**, the programming language you'll be writing code in.\n","2. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**, the code editor that will help you write, debug, and organize your code easily.\n","\n","Let’s walk through the steps for setting up both Python and VSCode in detail.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 1: Installing Python\n","\n","Python is a popular and versatile programming language that you'll be using throughout this course. To get started, you need to install Python on your computer.\n","\n","#### Option 1: Install the Latest Version of Python\n","1. Go to the official Python website: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n","2. You’ll see a button that says **Download Python [version number]**. This button automatically detects your operating system and suggests the latest version of Python.\n","3. Click the button to download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n","4. After the installer is downloaded, open it and follow the installation instructions.\n","    - **Important**: During installation, make sure to check the box that says **Add Python to PATH**. This will allow you to run Python commands from your command line or terminal.\n","5. Complete the installation by clicking **Install Now**.\n","\n","#### Option 2: Installing a Specific Version (Python 3.8.10)\n","Sometimes, you may need to use a specific version of Python for a project. Python 3.8.10 is a stable version that many people still use.\n","\n","1. Visit the official Python download page for older versions: [Python Release Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).\n","2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the installer for your operating system:\n","    - **Windows** users should download the Windows x86-64 executable installer.\n","    - **macOS** users should download the macOS installer.\n","3. Follow the same installation steps as above, ensuring that you check **Add Python to PATH**.\n","\n","#### Managing Multiple Python Versions with Pyenv (Optional don't do it unless experienced)\n","If you plan to work on different Python projects, you might need to switch between different versions of Python. This is where a tool like **pyenv** comes in handy. Pyenv allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Python on your system easily.\n","\n","- For macOS/Linux, follow these steps to install Pyenv:\n","    1. Open your terminal.\n","    2. Install pyenv by running the following commands one by one:\n","       ```bash\n","       curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n","       ```\n","    3. Follow the setup instructions that appear on the screen. It will guide you to add pyenv to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).\n","    4. Once pyenv is installed, you can install specific versions of Python using the following command:\n","       ```bash\n","       pyenv install 3.8.10\n","       ```\n","\n","- For **Windows** users, you’ll need a different tool called [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win):\n","    1. Follow the instructions in the [pyenv-win GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) to install pyenv on Windows.\n","    2. After installation, you can use it to manage multiple Python versions.\n","\n","#### Verifying Your Installation\n","To verify that Python is correctly installed on your system, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type the following command:\n","```bash\n","python --version\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"68b6083b","metadata":{},"source":["## 2. Python Basics: Variables and Data Types\n","\n","Before we begin, anything that follows '#' in a line is a commented out code. This means that you can see the text but it won't be ran as a code and ignored by the program. You would be able to tell with the text that follows it being green.\n","\n","### Variables\n","Variables in Python are used to store information. A variable is created by assigning a value to it using the equals (`=`) sign.\n","\n","```python\n","x = 5\n","name = 'Alice'\n","```\n","\n","In the example above, `x` is a variable (in this case integer) that stores the number `5`, and `name` stores the string `'Alice'`. Python is very convenient because we do not have to declare the types of variables unlike other languages. \n","\n","### Data Types\n","Python has several built-in data types. Some common ones are:\n","- **Integers**: whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3, 100)\n","- **Floats**: decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)\n","- **Strings**: sequences of characters (e.g., 'hello', 'Python')\n","- **Booleans**: represent True or False values\n","\n","Let's explore them further by assigning values to variables of different types."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7aa9fa23","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Variables and Data Types\n","x = 10  # Integer\n","pi = 3.14  # Float\n","name = 'Alice'  # String\n","is_student = True  # Boolean\n","\n","# Let's print them out\n","print(x)\n","print(pi)\n","print(name)\n","print(is_student)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a8e44bc1","metadata":{},"source":["Now I want you to try it out.
