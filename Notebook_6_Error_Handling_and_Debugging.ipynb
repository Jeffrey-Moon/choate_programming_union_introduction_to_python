Error handling allows your code to continue functioning even when something goes wrong, while debugging helps you identify and fix issues in your code.\n","\n","We'll cover the following topics:\n","\n","- Types of errors in Python\n","- Using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` for error handling\n","- Raising exceptions with `raise`\n","- Debugging using `assert` statements\n","- Introduction to debugging tools\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you'll have the tools to write more robust programs that can gracefully handle errors and be easier to debug."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"870060d0","metadata":{},"source":["## 1. Types of Errors\n","\n","Errors in Python generally fall into three categories:\n","\n","- **Syntax Errors**: Occur when Python encounters invalid code.\n","- **Runtime Errors**: Occur while the program is running (e.g., division by zero).\n","- **Logic Errors**: Occur when the program runs but doesn't produce the expected result.\n","\n","### Syntax Errors\n","Syntax errors are detected when Python attempts to parse your code. The code will not run if there is a syntax error."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b23bc488","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Syntax Error\n","print('Hello, world'  # Missing closing parenthesis"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"aa3d92b0","metadata":{},"source":["### Runtime Errors\n","\n","Runtime errors are errors that occur while the program is running. These are sometimes called **exceptions**.\n","\n","Let's look at an example of a runtime error where the program tries to divide by zero."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"36e9b3bc","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Runtime Error (ZeroDivisionError)\n","x = 10\n","y = 0\n","result = x / y  # Division by zero will raise an error"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c22f83b2","metadata":{},"source":["### Logic Errors\n","\n","Logic errors occur when the code runs without any syntax or runtime errors, but the result is not what you expect due to flawed logic.\n","\n","For example, let’s say we want to calculate the average of two numbers, but the code below contains a logic error."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"5eb29bbf","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Logic Error\n","a = 5\n","b = 10\n","average = a + b / 2  # This will give an incorrect result due to operator precedence\n","print('Average:', average)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4df49e0b","metadata":{},"source":["## 2. Error Handling with `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`\n","\n","Python provides a way to handle exceptions using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This structure allows you to catch and handle errors without crashing the program.\n","\n","- **`try`**: The block of code you want to try (where an error might occur).\n","- **`except`**: Defines what to do if an error occurs.\n","- **`else`**: Optional block that runs if no error occurs.\n","- **`finally`**: Optional block that runs regardless of whether an error occurred or not.\n","\n","Let's see an example."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2823a50b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Handling division by zero\n","try:\n","    x = 10\n","    y = 0\n","    result = x / y\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print('Error: Cannot divide by zero!')\n","else:\n","    print('The result is:', result)\n","finally:\n","    print('Execution complete.')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"13e443b2","metadata":{},"source":["## 3.

Debugging with `assert`\n","\n","You can use the `assert` statement to test conditions in your code. If the condition evaluates to `False`, `assert` will raise an `AssertionError`. This is useful for debugging as it helps ensure that certain conditions are met during execution.\n","\n","Let's see an example."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8e923e02","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Using assert for debugging\n","def calculate_average(numbers):\n","    assert len(numbers) > 0, 'The list of numbers cannot be empty!'\n","    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n","\n","# Test the function\n","print(calculate_average([10, 20, 30]))  # This works fine\n","print(calculate_average([]))  # This will raise an AssertionError"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4278669d","metadata":{},"source":["## 5. Introduction to Debugging Tools\n","\n","Python provides a built-in debugger called **`pdb`**. This tool allows you to step through your code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions to find and fix issues in your code.\n","\n","To start the debugger, you can insert `pdb.set_trace()` in your code at the point where you want to start debugging.\n","\n","Here’s an example of using the `pdb` debugger."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"62bada04","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Using the pdb debugger\n","import pdb\n","\n","def add(a, b):\n","    pdb.set_trace()  # Start debugging here\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(5, 10)\n","print(result)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bf13db1d","metadata":{},"source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","In this notebook, we explored different types of errors and learned how to handle them using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. We also learned how to raise exceptions and use assertions for debugging. Finally, we introduced the `pdb` debugger, which is a powerful tool for stepping through code and finding bugs.\n","\n","Understanding error handling and debugging is essential for writing robust, maintainable code. As you gain more experience, these techniques will help you troubleshoot and fix problems more efficiently."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
