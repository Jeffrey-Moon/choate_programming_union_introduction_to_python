OOP makes it easier to organize and manage larger codebases by grouping related data and functions into classes.\n","\n","We'll cover the following topics:\n","\n","- What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n","- Classes and objects in Python\n","- Defining methods and attributes\n","- Constructors: the `__init__` method\n","- Inheritance and subclasses\n","- Polymorphism\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to define your own classes and use objects to structure your Python programs."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n","\n","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**. Objects are instances of **classes**, which can contain both **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods) that operate on the data.\n","\n","OOP helps us model real-world entities like cars, employees, or products by grouping related data and behaviors together."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 2. Defining Classes and Creating Objects\n","\n","A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n","\n","We define a class using the `class` keyword, and we can create an **object** (also called an instance) of that class by calling the class like a function.\n","\n","Let's define a class to represent a simple `Dog`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Defining a simple class\n","class Dog:\n","    def bark(self):  # Method\n","        print('Woof!')\n","\n","# Creating an object (instance) of the Dog class\n","my_dog = Dog()\n","my_dog.bark()  # Call the bark method"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Attributes and Methods\n","\n","A **method** is a function that is defined inside a class and is used to operate on objects of that class. Methods are defined just like regular functions, but they must always include `self` as the first parameter.\n","\n","The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class and allows us to access attributes and other methods within the class.\n","\n","Let's add some attributes (data) to our `Dog` class."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Adding attributes to a class\n","class Dog:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor method to initialize attributes\n","        self.name = name  # Attribute\n","        self.age = age    # Attribute\n","\n","    def bark(self):  # Method\n","        print(f'{self.name} says Woof!')\n","\n","# Creating an object of the Dog class\n","my_dog = Dog('Buddy', 3)\n","print(my_dog.name)  # Accessing an attribute\n","print(my_dog.age)\n","my_dog.bark()  # Calling a method"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 3. The `__init__` Method (Constructor)\n","\n","The `__init__` method is a special method that is automatically called when a new object is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.\n","\n","The `__init__` method is also called the **constructor** because it constructs the object by setting up its initial state."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 4. Inheritance: Creating Subclasses\n","\n","Inheritance allows us to define a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. The new class (child or subclass) can extend or modify the behavior of the parent class.\n","\n","Let's create a subclass called `Puppy` that inherits from the `Dog` class."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Inheritance in Python\n","class Puppy(Dog):  # Puppy is a subclass of Dog\n","    def __init__(self, name, age, breed):\n","        super().__init__(name, age)  # Call the constructor of the parent class\n","        self.breed = breed  # New attribute specific to Puppy\n","\n","    def play(self):  # New method specific to Puppy\n","        print(f'{self.name} is playing!')\n","\n","# Creating an object of the Puppy class\n","my_puppy = Puppy('Max', 1, 'Labrador')\n","my_puppy.bark()  # Inherited from Dog\n","my_puppy.play()  # Defined in Puppy\n","print(my_puppy.breed)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Using `super()`\n","\n","The `super()` function allows us to call methods of the parent class in the subclass. This is useful when we want to extend or override the behavior of the parent class while still using some of its functionality."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 5. Polymorphism\n","\n","Polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In other words, different classes can share the same method name but implement it in their own way.\n","\n","Let's see an example where we define a `bark()` method in both the `Dog` and `Puppy` classes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: Polymorphism in Python\n","class Cat:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print('Meow!')\n","\n","class Dog:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print('Woof!')\n","\n","# Function that can take any animal and call its speak method\n","def make_sound(animal):\n","    animal.speak()\n","\n","# Creating objects\n","my_cat = Cat()\n","my_dog = Dog()\n","\n","# Both objects can use the same function\n","make_sound(my_cat)  # Output: Meow!\n","make_sound(my_dog)  # Output: Woof!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","In this notebook, we introduced the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. We covered classes, objects, attributes, methods, and constructors. We also explored inheritance, polymorphism, and how to create subclasses that extend the functionality of a parent class.\n","\n","OOP is a powerful way to model complex programs and systems, and it helps you write organized, reusable, and maintainable code. As you practice using these concepts, you will find it easier to build larger, more complex programs."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
