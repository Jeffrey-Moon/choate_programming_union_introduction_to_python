Using Built-in Libraries\n","\n","Python comes with many useful built-in libraries that you can use without having to install anything.

Installing and Importing External Libraries with `pip`\n","\n","While Python's built-in libraries are powerful, sometimes you'll need additional tools. External libraries are available via the Python Package Index (PyPI), and you can install them using the `pip` package manager.\n","\n","To install a library, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n","\n","```bash\n","pip install library_name\n","```\n","\n","For example, to install the `numpy` library, you would run:\n","\n","```bash\n","pip install numpy\n","```\n","\n","Once installed, you can import the library into your Python code and start using it."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 3.
